- [generic_functions/](generic_functions/) contains the scripts to (i) load the scores from the folder [compute_metrics/scores/](../compute_metrics/scores/), and (ii) all functions related to the ranking process (the process itself, the permutation test and the calculation of the quality criteria),
- [main_figs/](main_figs/) contains the scripts to reproduce the main figures of the paper. Each script is labelled with the corresponding number of the figure (eventually the letter of the corresponding panel). There are also some supplementary figures that were done at the same time of few main figures for the sake of simplicity (supplementary figures 5, 9 and 10),
- [supp_figs/](supp_figs/) contains the scripts to do the supplementary figures of the paper.
